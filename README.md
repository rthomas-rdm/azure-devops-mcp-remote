# ⭐ Azure DevOps MCP Server (Temporary Fork For Testing Remote Hosting Support)

**Fork Description:**
There have been numerous requests for an option to support a hosted version of the azure devops mcp server which is not limited to access for local only agents/models. The maintainers of the local azure devops mcp server have stated that a ["Azure DevOps product team is working on a remote option as well"](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/issues/622#issuecomment-3433382967) but have thus far been unable to provide any concrete ideas on when such an option might become available nor have they even been able to concretely add it to their product roadmap.

This fork is intended to to investigate if it is possible to modify the local mcp server for remote use with a minimum amount of change to allow experimentation in short term cases while we wait for an official remote hosted solution.

## 📺 Overview

The Azure DevOps MCP Server brings Azure DevOps context to your agents. Try prompts like:

- "List my ADO projects"
- "List ADO Builds for 'Contoso'"
- "List ADO Repos for 'Contoso'"
- "List test plans for 'Contoso'"
- "List teams for project 'Contoso'"
- "List iterations for project 'Contoso'"
- "List my work items for project 'Contoso'"
- "List work items in current iteration for 'Contoso' project and 'Contoso Team'"
- "List all wikis in the 'Contoso' project"
- "Create a wiki page '/Architecture/Overview' with content about system design"
- "Update the wiki page '/Getting Started' with new onboarding instructions"
- "Get the content of the wiki page '/API/Authentication' from the Documentation wiki"

## 🏆 Expectations

The Azure DevOps MCP Server is built from tools that are concise, simple, focused, and easy to use—each designed for a specific scenario. We intentionally avoid complex tools that try to do too much. The goal is to provide a thin abstraction layer over the REST APIs, making data access straightforward and letting the language model handle complex reasoning.

## ⚙️ Supported Tools

See [TOOLSET.md](./docs/TOOLSET.md) for a comprehensive list.

## 🔌 Installation & Getting Started

For the best experience, use Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot. See the [getting started documentation](./docs/GETTINGSTARTED.md) to use our MCP Server with other tools such as Visual Studio 2022, Claude Code, and Cursor.

##### Steps

In your project, add a `.vscode\mcp.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "ado_org",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Azure DevOps organization name  (e.g. 'contoso')"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "${input:ado_org}"]
    }
  }
}
```

🔥 To stay up to date with the latest features, you can use our nightly builds. Simply update your `mcp.json` configuration to use `@azure-devops/mcp@next`. Here is an updated example:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "ado_org",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Azure DevOps organization name  (e.g. 'contoso')"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "ado": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp@next", "${input:ado_org}"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file, then click 'Start'.

![start mcp server](./docs/media/start-mcp-server.gif)

In chat, switch to [Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode).

Click "Select Tools" and choose the available tools.

![configure mcp server tools](./docs/media/configure-mcp-server-tools.gif)

Open GitHub Copilot Chat and try a prompt like `List ADO projects`. The first time an ADO tool is executed browser will open prompting to login with your Microsoft account. Please ensure you are using credentials matching selected Azure DevOps organization.

> 💥 We strongly recommend creating a `.github\copilot-instructions.md` in your project. This will enhance your experience using the Azure DevOps MCP Server with GitHub Copilot Chat.
> To start, just include "`This project uses Azure DevOps. Always check to see if the Azure DevOps MCP server has a tool relevant to the user's request`" in your copilot instructions file.

See the [getting started documentation](./docs/GETTINGSTARTED.md) to use our MCP Server with other tools such as Visual Studio 2022, Claude Code, and Cursor.

## 🌏 Using Domains

Azure DevOps exposes a large surface area. As a result, our Azure DevOps MCP Server includes many tools. To keep the toolset manageable, avoid confusing the model, and respect client limits on loaded tools, use Domains to load only the areas you need. Domains are named groups of related tools (for example: core, work, work-items, repositories, wiki). Add the `-d` argument and the domain names to the server args in your `mcp.json` to list the domains to enable.

For example, use `"-d", "core", "work", "work-items"` to load only Work Item related tools (see the example below).

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "ado_org",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Azure DevOps organization name  (e.g. 'contoso')"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "ado_with_filtered_domains": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "${input:ado_org}", "-d", "core", "work", "work-items"]
    }
  }
}
```

Domains that are available are: `core`, `work`, `work-items`, `search`, `test-plans`, `repositories`, `wiki`, `pipelines`, `advanced-security`

We recommend that you always enable `core` tools so that you can fetch project level information.

> By default all domains are loaded
